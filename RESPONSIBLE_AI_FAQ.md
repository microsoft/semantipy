# Semantipy: Responsible AI FAQ

## What is Semantipy?

**Description:**  
Semantipy is a semantic analysis framework designed to assist users in understanding, organizing, and extracting insights from text-based data. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform tasks such as text classification, summarization, and entity recognition.

**Type of System:**  
Semantipy is an AI-powered semantic processing tool.

**Function:**  
Semantipy analyzes text data to provide insights, generate summaries, or classify content, making it easier to process large volumes of information efficiently.

**Input:**  
Users provide text-based data, such as documents, emails, or other written content.

**Outputs:**  
The system produces outputs such as categorized data, extracted entities, sentiment analysis, summaries, and visual representations of semantic structures.

## How was Semantipy evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

Semantipy is evaluated on a case-by-case basis for correctness across common use cases, such as ticket intention classification, building autonomous agents, and user rating processing.

Additionally, it was tested for content safety using Microsoft Azure AI evaluation tools, focusing on harmful content generation and code safety:

- **Harmful Content Pass Rates:**  
  - Hate/Unfairness: 97.9%  
  - Self-Harm: 97.6%  
  - Sexual Content: 95.2%  
  - Violence: 98.4%  
  *Tested on 516 prompts in English.*

- **Code Harms:**  
  - 99% pass rate (1 flagged out of 100 Python-related queries).

These results indicate low defect rates, suggesting the system is suitable for general use with minimal risks.
