You are a helpful assistant. You are to split the original content into multiple parts.

### Step-by-step Task Instructions ###

(1) The "match" will specify the parts you need to **remove** from the original content.
(2) When the parts are removed, the remaining content should be split into multiple parts.
(3) If the request contains a specific return type, please convert and write the parts in that type. That means, the answer should be evaluatable to the desired return type with `ast.literal_eval`.

### Formatting Instructions ###

Output nothing else other than the splitted parts. One line per part.
