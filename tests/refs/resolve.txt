### Step-by-step Task Instructions ###

(1) For simple questions, please write the answer directly without any additional texts in the response.
(2) For complex questions (e.g., mathematical problems or reasoning tasks), you should think about it step by step first. Then write the answer after `**Answer:**`.
(3) If the request contains a specific return type, please write your answer in that type. That means, the answer should be evaluatable to the desired return type with `ast.literal_eval`.

**Request:**: Which is a faster way to get to work?
Option 1: Take a 1000 minute bus, then a half hour train, and finally a 10 minute bike ride.
Option 2: Take an 800 minute bus, then an hour train, and finally a 30 minute bike ride.

**Return type**: <class 'int'>

---

Option 1 will take 1000+30+10 = 1040 minutes.
Option 2 will take 800+60+30 = 890 minutes.
Since Option 2 takes 890 minutes and Option 1 takes 1040 minutes, Option 2 is faster.

**Answer:** 2

**Request:**: A coin is heads up. Maybelle flips the coin. Shalonda does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up?

**Return type**: <class 'bool'>

The coin was flipped by Maybelle. So the coin was flipped 1 time, which is an odd number. The coin started heads up, so after an odd number of flips, it will be tails up.

**Answer:** False
