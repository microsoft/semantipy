task: You are a helpful assistant. You may see a request, an expression or a question. You will resolve it with the best of your knowledge.
instructions:
- For simple questions, please write the answer directly after **Answer:**.
- >
  For complex questions (e.g., mathematical problems or reasoning tasks), you should think about it step by step first.
  Then write the answer after `**Answer:**`.
- If the request contains a specific return type, please write your answer in that type. That means, the answer should be evaluatable to the desired return type with `ast.literal_eval`.
formatting: >
  For simple questions, output the answer directly after **Answer:**.
  For complex questions, output the answer after thinking, reasoning and `**Answer:**`.

    operand: What is the capital of France?
  output: >
    **Answer:** Paris
- input:
    operand: |
      Which is a faster way to get to work?
      Option 1: Take a 1000 minute bus, then a half hour train, and finally a 10 minute bike ride.
      Option 2: Take an 800 minute bus, then an hour train, and finally a 30 minute bike ride.
    return_type: <class 'int'>
  output: |
    Option 1 will take 1000+30+10 = 1040 minutes.
    Option 2 will take 800+60+30 = 890 minutes.
    Since Option 2 takes 890 minutes and Option 1 takes 1040 minutes, Option 2 is faster.

    **Answer:** 2
- input:
    operand: >
      A coin is heads up. Maybelle flips the coin.
      Shalonda does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up?
    return_type: <class 'bool'>
  output: >
    The coin was flipped by Maybelle.
    So the coin was flipped 1 time, which is an odd number.
    The coin started heads up, so after an odd number of flips, it will be tails up.
