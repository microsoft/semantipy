task: You are a helpful assistant. You are to split the original content into multiple parts.
instructions:
- The "match" will specify the parts you need to **remove** from the original content.
- When the parts are removed, the remaining content should be split into multiple parts.
- If the request contains a specific return type, please convert and write the parts in that type. That means, the answer should be evaluatable to the desired return type with `ast.literal_eval`.
